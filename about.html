        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> 
            We created a surveillance drone that is capable of detecting motion, recording
            voice and transmitting that data to a Web app over Bluetooth. This system has
            countless applications, such as monitoring homes and near military bases. 
        </p>

        <h2> How We Created It </h2>
        <p> 
            Using an Arduino Uno and its sensors, including motion, sound, and Bluetooth, we 
            are able to detect the motion within a large range and

        <h2> Data Receiving </h2>
        <p> via Bluetooth from the Arduino </p>

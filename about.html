                <h2> About </h2>
                <p> 
                    We created a prototype for a surveillance drone that is capable of detecting and recording motion,
                    and transmitting that data to a computer system over Bluetooth. This system is then
                    able to send the data over to a Web browser, who can provide real-time updates. This
                    project has countless security applications, including monitoring homes to prevent homes
                    break-ins, and monitoring near country borders to prevent illegal crossings. 
                </p>
                <br> <br>
                
                <h2> How We Created It </h2>
                <p> 
                    Using an Arduino Uno and its sensors, including motion, sound, and Bluetooth, we 
                    are able to detect the slightest motion within a large range.

                <h2> Data Receiving </h2>
                <p> Currently trying to use the Firebase Realtime Database to 
                </p>
                <br> <br>
                
                <h2> Extensions </h2>
                <p> Some possible extensions we could implement for the system include attaching the sound 
                    sensor when available so voice recordings could potentially be transmitted to the 
                    Web browser. We could also use speech-to-text recognition tools to provide the Web with 
                    more forms of data. 
                    <br>
                    A potential machine learning application could include running various tests on data 
                    received to determine whether there are clear sentiments involved, or photo analysis for 
                    crime scenes.

## How to run the Website 

### Steps to Run on Windows Powershell:

1. Clone repository

2. Change to file directory in Powershell 

    ex. `cd Documents/enghack-site`
    
3. Type the following command and wait for it to finish installation:

    `npm install`

4. Type:

    `npm start`

Note: The website retrieves information from a file called `data.txt` that should be located in the same folder as the source code. You can simply create that text file, add some information there, save it, and you'll see it updated to the server almost immediately!
